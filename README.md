# React + Vite

Dear Developer who is reading this, I thank you for this assignment. made me put 5 hrs to figure out the test cases. But got to learn something new.

I have used react query instead of traditional useEffect hook as it is more powerful and gives the states like loading and error.

I have also used the router params to move the data from post list to post details page, for the ease and mentainability, passing through props would have required prop upscalling and drilling & creating a context api didn't seem necessary for just one data object.

I have also used the tailwind css for the ease and customization capabilities.

I wasn't sure what was needed to be done with the content as it's not coming completely so instead of web scraping I decided to put a read full article button. 


I hope you like the project. will be waiting for a mail or call for next round.
